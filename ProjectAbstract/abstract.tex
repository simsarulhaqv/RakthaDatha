This report describes our group's implementation of a blood donation
management system. We used the Entity-Relationship model to design
a database that will store and organize the library's data. We have
created the database using SQL and populated it with some sample
data. The system can keep track of blood donor informations, patients who have donated blood,
and the relationships
between them. Using MySQL, and PHP, we have
created an Internet-based graphical user interface that allows
the patients and the donors to access the system remotely.
